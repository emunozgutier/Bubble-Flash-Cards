  "title": "Handle end-game input and update tests",
  "message": "When the game is finished (game_over or won), input handlers now perform summary actions: handleCorrect triggers gameStore.continueGame(), and handleIncorrect navigates to main. Effect hooks were re-bound to include gameState and showHelpModal so listeners update correctly when state changes. Tests were updated to import setupInputListeners and useGameStore directly, to use vi.mocked(useGameStore) for store stubbing, and a new test verifies that pressing Next in the summary calls continueGame.",
