  "title": "Sync drawing state with URL and history",
  "message": "Initialize and synchronize the drawing card with URL search params. Added a helper to read draw/def from the URL and set drawingCard in the navigation store on load, and updated setDrawingCard to update URL params via history.pushState. Added navigateTo behavior to clear draw/def when navigating back to the main page. Also added a popstate handler in App.jsx to update app state when the user uses browser back/forward so deep links and history navigation keep state consistent.",
