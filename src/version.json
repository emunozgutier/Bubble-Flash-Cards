  "title": "Add Edit Deck page and Drive delete support",
  "message": "Add a full EditDeckPage (JSX + CSS) allowing users to rename, edit, add/delete cards, save to Drive, and delete a deck; wire it into App routing and add an Edit button to DeckInfoPage. Implement deleteFile in GoogleDriveWriteServices and export saveFile/createFolder/deleteFile from googleDriveService. Add removeDeckFileId to useDriveStore to update Drive file ID mappings when decks are renamed or removed. Also adjust navigation keys (bubble -> game-bubble, createDeck -> create-deck) to match new route names.",
