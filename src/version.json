  "message": "Replace GitHub API-based fetching with local git commands using child_process.execSync to generate src/version.json. The script now reads the short hash, commit date, title, and body from the local repository, writes version.json, and logs the result; if git is unavailable it writes a minimal fallback entry. Also updates src/version.json metadata to reflect the new local-git-derived values. This change avoids relying on the GitHub API (rate limits/auth) and supports offline builds.",
