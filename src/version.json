  "message": "Allow vertical scrolling and improve mobile layout for the CharacterDraw page. CSS: change overflow to overflow-y:auto, add responsive adjustments under 600px (reduced container padding, column layout for controls, style-selector/style-btn/next-btn sizing, scale toggle-switch, spacing tweaks). JSX: replace the checkbox toggle with a single style button that toggles guided mode, and change the Skip/Next button label to show \"Close\" on the last character. Also update version.json with a deploy-time version hash/date.",
